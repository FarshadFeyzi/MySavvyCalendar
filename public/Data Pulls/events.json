Sandwiched between Carl Cox and Paul Oakenfold, the fast rise of Sander van Doorn is a testament to his talent. From the start Sander (and his alter egos: Sam Sharp, Purple Haze, Filterfunk & Sandler) has produced a variety of sounds, combining elements of trance, electro, techno and house. The first big achievement in his career was securing residencies at Judgment Sunday in Ibiza and at the Gallery in London. He gained recognition from the likes of Carl Cox, Armin van Buuren, and Tiesto, And Carl wasn\u2019t the only Sander fan, so he seized the opportunities at hand and dedicated himself to a relentless touring and production schedule for the next few years. It was during this time that Sander penned some of his classics. From originals like Grasshopper, Punk\u2019d and Riff, to massive remixes of The Killers (Spaceman), Sia (The Girl You Lost to Cocaine), Robbie Williams (Close My Eyes) and Depeche Mode (Peace), it seemed the lad from Eindhoven was on a collision course for superstardom. His debut artist album Supernaturalistic was released in 2008 to rave reviews and launched a 32 date global album tour. He followed this by winning the coveted prize of Best Breakthrough Artist at WMC\u2019s IDMA, where he also received a nomination for Best Underground Track with \u201cRiff.\u201d That same year he won Best Breakthrough DJ in the International Dance Music Awards at the Miami Winter Music Conference. Every year sees Sander playing to more than one million clubbers. He consistently headlines huge events from Sensation to Global Gathering, from Trance Energy and Mysteryland through to his high profile summer residency at Cream in Ibiza. In August 2010, Sander released his double CD compilation Dusk Till Doorn with a big launch party at the Avalon nightclub in Las Vegas, where Sander played an extended five hour set. Sander continued to bring his Dusk Till Doorn show to many nightclubs around the world and the list keeps on growing. In August 2012 it was announced that Sander van Doorn and various notable electronic music producers would be featured on the Halo 4 remix album."}, "Ferry Corsten": {"name": "Ferry Corsten", "start_time": "2018-02-16T21:00:00", "end_time": "2018-02-17T02:00:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ferry-corsten-tickets-42008909780?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "Ferry Corsten\nFriday February 16th \u2013 Doors Open at 9PM.

The word \u201clegend\u201d is at times thrown around too freely these days, but in the world of dance music the Johan Gielen name is engrained deep into the DNA of the trance genre \u2013 he\u2019s a founding father of the sound as a producer and DJ, an inspiration to fans and peers alike, and remains a highly energised and influential driving force in the scene today.\u00a0\nTrance Classics compilation series & Johan Gielen Trance Classics Worldtour\nThere\u2019s no better artist to deliver a Trance Classics set than Johan Gielen and he\u2019s delighted to deliver the sounds that the fans demand \u2013\u00a0the \u2019Johan Gielen Trance Classics concept\u2019\u00a0is\u00a0booming\u00a0in\u00a0clubland and festival\u00a0stages are planned for\u00a02018 which\u00a0. Johan also delivered\u00a0\u2018The World edition\u2019\u00a0of his popular Trance Classics compilation series on the\u00a0High Contrast\u00a0label.\nCareer\nWhen the global trance movement was arguably at the peak of its powers in the 2000\u2019s Johan Gielen ranked as high as\u00a0#24\u00a0in the prestigious\u00a0DJ Mag Top 100\u00a0DJs poll and, to this day, is the\u00a0only DJ\u00a0to\u00a0have performed 16 consecutive times at Trance Energy, the most celebrated of all trance festivals during this era, gaining him the nickname of \u201cMr Trance Energy\u201d. There\u2019s barely a big stage that hasn\u2019t been graced by Johan\u2019s presence and standout performances over the years \u2013\u00a0Tomorrowland, Sensation, Dance Valley, Godskitchen, Electronic Family, Mysteryland, Sunrise festival and top 100 clubs like Fabrik Madrid, Zouk Kuala Lumpur, BCM Mallorca, Guaba Cyprus, Avalon US, Ageha Tokyo are just a handful of highlights.\nAs a producer, Johan Gielen has been creating both club classics and\u00a0crossover anthems\u00a0since the dawn of trance music. As a solo artist. the pinnacle was surely his massive\u00a0\u2018Revelations\u2019 album, but he\u2019s also the key member of\u00a0famed and crowned with gold hit singles\u00a0like \u2018The Beauty Of Silence\u2019 / \u2018Twisted\u2019) and Airscape (\u2018Pacific Melody\u2019 / \u2018L\u2019Esperanza\u2019).\nDuring the 25 year career of Johan Gielen countless artists have risen and fallen, yet very few have stayed the course . The secret to Johan Gielen\u2019s enduring success is his commitment and consistency within the scene he loves. He was adorned with the nickname \u201cMr Trance Energy\u201d by his fans and he\u2019s stayed true to the genre he loves \u2013 the Johan Gielen name is!\n\u00a0\n4 Strings\nBehind the name 4 Strings hides 2 musicians, Carlo Resoort and Jan de Vos. The two have known each other since 1986. In 1990 they became interested in dance music and from that moment on, they started producing their own music. All their spare time was spent in the studio. Throughout the next couple of years not only did their skills expand but also the amount of equipment in their studio. With the new tools and experience that they had, they could finally discover in which direction they wanted to go with their musical careers: Carlo decided to stay in the studio while Jan found his passion in mixing and started his DJ-ing career.\nJan met up with Piet Bervoets (Carlos, ROOS and Rank 1). Piet taught him the basics of mixing. After a couple of months, Jan joined a drive-in-show, where he played all kinds of music from R&B, Top 40 to Happy Hardcore. His skills were improving rapidly, and it was during this time period he noticed that his main interest was in dance music. After winning a first place prize in a DJ contest, he was offered his very own residency.\nCarlo Resoort started with dance music in 1994, and soon after that he had his first release. After a couple of releases he had his first major breakthrough: \u201cCarlos \u2013 the silmarilla\u201d, produced together with Piet Bervoets of Rank 1. Two years later he had another hit with \u201cTurn it around\u201d. Around this same time, a new record company was born, \u201cSpinnin Records\u201d. Shortly thereafter Carlo signed his first record deal and 4 Strings was born.\n\u201cDaytime\u201d was the first track of 4 Strings, supported by Paul van Dyk, Judge Jules and Tiesto. The follow up was \u201cInto the night\u201d, which got even more support. After a vocal edit called \u201cTake me away\u201d it became a huge hit around the globe, even now the track can be heard worldwide.\n\u201cDiving\u201d and \u201cLet it rain\u201d were the follow ups, and soon the first album was released. After remixing \u201cSummer Sun\u201d they started to work on their second album \u201cTurn it around\u201d. The album was named after the new single which is a remake from Carlo\u2019s former project \u201cAlena\u201d. Carlo also started another project under his own name, with productions like \u201cRemover\u201d, \u201cO\u201d class\u201d, \u201cMusica\u201d, \u201cAyers Rock\u201d and \u201cRise\u201d.\nIn 2005, 4 Strings released another hit \u201cSunrise\u201d, this track was the theme of the number one dance music festival in Poland also called Sunrise.\nDJ 4 Strings is not just your average DJ, he is an entertainer. He is part of the new generation of DJ\u2019s today. Crowds are amazed by his refreshing and unique style of playing music. DJ 4 Strings is always prepared with unpredictable and quality tracks that both excite existing fans and bring new people to the scene. There is so much good music out there and 4 Strings do not want to limit themselves to one style. 4 Strings is also in the top 10 for Holland on \u201cThe DJ List\u201d.\n4 Strings touring diary is incredibly hectic for 2006, with regular stops at major venues in the world. Such as touring the USA, Australia, Mexico, Poland, Asia and Holland just to name a few. 2006 is sure to be a massive year with the release of their brand new track \u201cHurricane\u201d and also playing at the leading trance party of Holland \u201cTrance Energy\u201d in February. Summer 2006 will also see the first ever unique \u201c4 Strings Live Tour\u201d worldwide.

Sander has become synonymous with excellence \u2013 both production wise and in front of the thousands he plays to, nightly. He is truly one of the strongholds in dance music. A generation defining artist, that reshapes our perception of what dance music can be and he does it all with that electrifying Sander van Doorn-smile.With two full length albums, numerous hit-singles, remixes of the worlds biggest artists, his own successful record label \u2018Doorn Records\u2019 and a weekly radio show that will air its 250th show in September of this year. Add to that sold out gigs in all major venues and festivals like Ultra Miami, Electric Daisy Carnival New York and Las Vegas and his own stage at Tomorrowland it\u2019s almost impossible not to have come across the name Sander van Doorn at least once in your life.SvD-styleEvery successful artist\u2019s story reads as a fairytale and Sander\u2019s begins back in 2004, with the release of \u2018Loaded\u2019. The production skills he showed in his first releases ignited an earthquake in the international EDM community and catapulted him in the top-10 of biggest DJ\u2019s worldwide. Hailed and hyped by all the big names, his typical \u2018SvD-style\u2019 productions topped the club charts worldwide and resulted in his first full length album \u2018Supernaturalistic\u2019 (2008). More big names started knocking on his door, which led to the massive collaboration with Robbie Williams (Close my Eyes) and the renowned remix of Sia\u2019s \u2018Girl on Cocaine\u2019.He also scored international radio hits like; \u2018Love is Darkness\u2019 and \u2018Koko\u2019 which was premiered by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1. 'Koko' reached the #1 position on Beatport, The Cool Cuts Chart and the DMC UK Buzz Chart. Sander continued to work hard and the fruits of his labour resulted in his second album \u2018Eleve11\u2019 (2011). This gained him even more stardom and allowed him to perfect his already infamous live performances.SpittingWhile most artists take a short break after releasing an album, Sander kept spitting out Aclass releases like \u2018Chasin\u2019, \u2018Nothing Inside\u2019, \u2018What Did I Do\u2019 with Block Party singer Kele, \u2018Drink To Get Drunk\u2019, \u2018Who\u2019s Wearing The Cap\u2019 with Laidback Luke and \u2018Kangaroo\u2019 with youngster Julian Jordan.In 2014, Sander van Doorn once again proves to be one of dance music\u2019s most skilled producers. With releases like \u201cGuitar Track\u201d together with Firebeatz, \u201cGet Enough\u201d and of course the festival anthem of this summer \u201cGold Skies\u201d. This massive collaboration together with Martin Garrix and DVBBS is played out by countless DJs and held on to the #1 position in the Beatport charts for a long time. On big festivals like Electric Daisy Las Vegas, \u201cGold Skies\u201d was one of the most played tracks, so it\u2019s safe to say that this infectious track is a true summer hit and there is more in the tank for 2014!"}, "Presidents Day Extravaganza": {"name": "Presidents Day Extravaganza", "start_time": "2018-02-17T19:00:00", "end_time": "2018-02-18T02:00:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/presidents-day-extravaganza-tickets-42155901436?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "Presidents DAY Extravaganza02.17.18.

OCWD ensures a reliable supply of high quality water for 2.4 million residents in north and central Orange County, while protecting environmental habitats and natural resources. OCWD partnered with the City of Santa Ana for the Mid-Basin injection project in Centennial Park which is currently under construction. The project includes construction of nearly two miles of pipeline, public park enhancements, two monitoring wells, and four wells to inject GWRS product water directly into the Principal aquifer near areas with concentrated groundwater production and relatively low groundwater levels. The project will provide additional basin recharge capacity that must be developed to support the GWRS Final Expansion Project, raise groundwater levels in the Principal aquifer, and reduce the amount of GWRS water that must be send to the Anaheim surface recharge basins thereby allowing those basins to be utilized for capturing Santa Ana River storm flows and recharging untreated import water. Tetra Tech designed the project, Butier and Geotechnical Consultants are construction managers, and the primary contractors are Pacific Hydrotech and Best Drilling and Pump. \u00a0\r\nTime: Lunch @ 11:50 am; Program ends @ 1:00 pm\r\nLocation: Dave and Busters' at Irvine Spectrum, 661 Spectrum Center Drive, Irvine, CA (949) 727-0555\r\nCost: $45 at the door, $35 advanced payment by mail, PayPal or credit card, $40 registered but pay at the door, Students $15 at the door with school ID\r\nFor PayPal payment, please send payment to: HHTG_OC@yahoo.com\r\nMail checks payable to \"ASCE HHTG\" and RSVP to:\r\nJenny Robinet, EWRI Treasurer\r\n17520 Newhope Street, Suite 200, Fountain Valley, CA 92708\r\nConfirm: Call (714) 481-7238, or e-mail to: asceocewri@gmail.com\r\n\u00a0"}, "The State of the Economy by The Orange County CFO Leadership Council": {"name": "The State of the Economy by The Orange County CFO Leadership Council", "start_time": "2018-02-08T07:15:00", "end_time": "2018-02-08T09:30:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-state-of-the-economy-by-the-orange-county-cfo-leadership-council-tickets-41414636292?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "The State of the Economyhosted by\u00a0The Orange County CFO Leadership CouncilThursday, February 8, 20177:15 AM to 8:00 AM\u00a0Networking\u00a0| 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM\u00a0ProgramOur Speaker:\n\n\nToday\u2019s CFOs face a dynamic, evolving and a challenging economic environment.\u00a0 With the stock market hitting record highs, low unemployment, and climbing interest rates, the US economy continues to grow.\u00a0 However, what will the future bring?\u00a0 Having an informed line of sight on today\u2019s state of the economy and understanding its implications enable CFO\u2019s to make informed decisions and proactively position their organization to take advantage of emerging opportunities while avoiding unnecessary risks.\nMake plans to join us on Thursday, February 8th\u00a0and participate in a thought-provoking discussion with\u00a0Col.

Only if we have 12-16 players sign up will this Bunco date proceed. So it is Tentative as of now. ~\nThe\u00a0South Orange County\u00a0Bunco group is comprised of ladies in their 30's - early 40's (although we have players in their early 50's who look younger that I do!) who are funny and awesome on the inside and out. (If you are anywhere near a wallflower, super quiet or always\u00a0too shy to come out of your shell and really socialize with strangers, this group may not be for you. Bunco is a dice game and gamers who like wine and cocktails often have the most fun of all!)\nFor Buncos on the First Friday of Every Monthly:\n1 - Bring $8 in cash (single $1 bills - if you please) that covers appetizers, table snacks, dinner, dessert, wine and cocktails. (Players usually Uber home around 11:00 because it's open bar. Just FYI.)\n2 - For the Appearance Theme, is To Be Determined - the official invitation will state it. (An example\u00a0is 'Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s' (dress, pearls, gloves, hat, sunglasses, etc.)\n3 - The Gift Theme is To Be Determined\u00a0- the official invitation will state it. (An example is 'everything that smells divine'.)\n4 - This is important:  Buy the Bunco gift every month with cash - only - so that any returns exchanges to the store by the winner of your gift can be a breeze. So that means\u00a0you can't buy a gift card and\u00a0you can't buy anything on Amazon, etc.\u00a0(We loathe store credit!) * We will check when you arrive that your receipt states that you paid with cash for the Bunco gift. *\n5 - Bring the receipt for the $25 + gift in an envelope or bag with you to Bunco. (In case the winner prefers to return the Bunco prize later on.) Presenting the Bunco gift and the receipt together is mandatory.\n6 - The Bunco gift each month must be a surprise. So bring the gift wrapped or in a gift bag or a garbage bag or anything opaque. The\u00a0winner picks the Bunco gift out as a surprise.\n7\u00a0- Bunco in General:\nEvery player that RSVP's YES gets a Punchbowl / Evite electronic invitation - because there's a lot of details for Bunco (if a person has never heard of it or played it.) So we have to send the invitation to all players electronically to make sure all players are on board with what to wear, what cash to bring and what to buy as their gift. Message a way for me to send that invitation to you electronically, if you RSVP that Yes you are definitely attending in the future.\n8\u00a0- If you are new to Bunco and you want to bring a friend - that would be totally cool! Message me their info and they will be sent an invitation as well.\n9\u00a0- Bunco attendance each month is first come, first served - because Bunco has a set number of players (12 or 16). The members of this group that RSVP first will be sent the Punchbowl / Evite invitation. After the player maximum is reached that are attending, then the women that RSVP on\u00a0EventBrite\u00a0will move to a stand-by list to play for that month.\n10\u00a0- Stand-by is not bad at all! Players sometimes have to unavoidably cancel at the last minute, so we contact the stand-by list immediately and see who is still available to come play Bunco for that date.\n11 - Hope you get a chance to come play Bunco sometime and meet all the funny hottie biscotti players!\n** Contact the Coordinator of Bunco for this 12/1/17 event with your contact info so you can be sent the official monthly Bunco Punchbowl invitation that you also need to RSVP to in order to be confirmed for the Bunco event. **"}, "Speed Dating Event | Orange County  | Singles - Fancy a Go?

Your help provides families in need with this critical support.\u00a0\nDue the limited space, we ask that all interested volunteers register using this form.\nFirst Time Volunteering?\nIf you are a first-time volunteer for The Raise Foundation Food Distribution, please contact The Raise Foundation to arrange for a brief in-person or over-the-phone interview.\nAdditional Volunteer Opportunities\nManzanita Park\nTypically on the 4th Saturday of the month.\u00a0Click here to learn more\nSouth Orange County Family Resource Center\nTypically on the 4th Thursday of the month.\u00a0Click here to learn more\nMendocino at Talega\nTypically on the 1st Saturday of the month.\u00a0Click here to learn more"}, "Divisions F and G, Toastmasters Club Officer Evening Training": {"name": "Divisions F and G, Toastmasters Club Officer Evening Training", "start_time": "2018-02-12T18:00:00", "end_time": "2018-02-12T19:30:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/divisions-f-and-g-toastmasters-club-officer-evening-training-tickets-42540519840?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "Division F and G, Toastmasters Club Officer Training, evening session at located at the Girl Scouts of OC."}, "Understanding Community Choice Energy and its Opportunities": {"name": "Understanding Community Choice Energy and its Opportunities", "start_time": "2018-04-11T10:00:00", "end_time": "2018-04-11T15:00:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/understanding-community-choice-energy-and-its-opportunities-tickets-42693917657?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "The conference is organized and presented by OC Clean Power, a non-partisan alliance of stakeholder groups advocating for clean energy in Orange County. \nThe goals of the conference are:1) To introduce and thoroughly explain Community Choice Energy (CCE) to city staff, elected officials, and the public2) To explain CCE\u2019s potential benefits to residents, businesses, and city governments throughout Orange County.\n*Keynote speaker: Kevin de Leon, President pro Tem, California State Senate (confirmed)\nIndustry experts working with CCEs throughout California will present on:\n\nCCE study, start up, and operation\nFundamentals of wholesale and retail energy purchase and delivery\nIndustry updates\nAdditional opportunities and benefits CCEs can offer to consumers\nHow Orange County cities can get started down the CCE path\n\nPanelists include:\n\nHoward Choy, moderator\nEES Consulting\nThe Energy Coalition\nICF\nVanir Sustainability\nThe Energy Authority\nConstellation Power\nKit Cole Consulting\nCalpine\n\n\u00a0FAQs\nDo I have to register to attend?

At age 14, she joined a band with close friends with whom she fostered her art and performed countless gigs for five years. Lead singer, keyboardist, and cajon player of the group, Krista performed at notable venues, such as the Troubadour and the Viper Room. Meanwhile, at Huntington Beach High School, Krista was a part of the Music Media Entertainment Technology program of the Academy for the Performing Arts (APA MMET) through which she cultivated her songwriting and performing skills, and discovered her interest in production.\nIn June of 2016, Krista released her debut EP, \u201cBittersweet,\u201d which she wrote and co-produced. The following November, she collaborated with producer Arc North to create \u201cMeant To Be,\u201d a single she both sang and co-wrote. Krista continues to write for herself and other artists, lend her voice to collaborations, play shows, and immerse herself in various pockets of music.

Home to thousands, misunderstood by millions, Cabrini Green once towered over Chicago\u2019s most valuable neighborhoods. A looming reminder of inequality and poverty, Cabrini\u2019s high-rises were demolished and an African-American community cleared to make room for another social experiment: mixed-income neighborhoods.Shot over the course of 20-years, 70 Acres in Chicago documents this upheaval, from the razing of the first buildings in 1995, to the clashes in the mixed-income neighborhoods a decade later. The film tells the volatile story of this hotly contested patch of land, while looking unflinchingly at race, class, and who has the right to live in the city.After the screening, a discussion of the film will take place with director Ronit Bezalel, Andrew Highsmith (History, UCI),\u00a0Virginia Parks (Planning and Public Policy, UCI), and Rodolfo Torres (Planning and Public Policy, UCI).\u00a0 \nReception to follow.

This was probably the best investment I\u2019ve made in\u00a0MTB. If I were to come up with a marketing phrase for your type of work, I\u2019d say: \u201cinvest in your skills, not a more expensive bike\u201d.\nI do have to tell you: your F6 book definitely prepared me for this session. I was a little tired during the climb, but I had the energy and strength to get the benefit of the downhill sections and Andy\u2019s tips. And I for sure wasn\u2019t destroyed by the end of the day.\nAnyway, I know I have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m excited and I have enough building blocks to work with thanks to you guys. This will not be the last time that I enroll for a class at the Rad Academy.\n~Carlos\n--- \u00a0 --- \u00a0 ---\nHi Lee,\nJust took a clinic with Coach Andy yesterday. Super cool dude! He helped me fine tune a few of the things from your book I\u2019ve been working on for the past year or so. Should definitely help me pick up a few seconds here and there on my rides. He even helped me squeak out a bit of extra speed to be able to beat him down one of the trails. The mark of a very solid coach I\u2019d say!\nRyan\u00a0\n--- \u00a0 --- \u00a0 ---\nHi Lee,\nLast week I took a skills class with Andy Somerville in Orange County and it has helped me a ton. Yesterday, I rode a trail where I usually walk two rocky sections but today I walked only one. I would have ridden both sections but lost momentum on one of them. The best part was that I was way more comfortable than I\u2019ve ever been and it turns out that I got a PR on that segment. It was great being in control and having fun. I wish I took this clinic years ago.\nCheers,Mike\n--- \u00a0 --- \u00a0 ---\nSee more riders comments here >>>\n"}, "Only 900!

However, over my 35 years of working with individuals and families I have come to realize that how we conceptualize\u00a0wealth, and our\u00a0relationship to that concept, can play an even greater role in our progress to wealth generation.\nTherefore, it is with great zeal that I announce our latest keynote event:\u00a0\nWealth is About Well-being\nAt the event we will explore\n\n\nthe concept of wealth as well-being;\n\n\nmoney not as an end, but\u00a0a means to creating a meaningful life;\n\n\nthe progress of our investment models; and\n\n\nthe next evolution of wealth planning and WMBC.\n\n\nAs this will be our most significant event to date we wanted the arrangements to reflect its magnitude, and no venue seemed to capture the vision like the\u00a0historic\u00a0Port Theater\u00a0in Corona Del Mar. Originally opened in 1949, the Port Theater has gone through extensive renovations bringing all the elegance of modernization while maintaining its soul as a film and art house.\n\nIn similar fashion,\u00a0we will have\u00a0the cuisine artists from Fork in the Road Catering there to create an\u00a0exquisite dining experience.\n\n\nWealth is About Well-being\u00a0is important. The event provides an opportunity for us to share with you the incredible work we have been putting together to benefit the lives of our clients, and without your participation and feedback it stifles our ability to continue to innovate in a way that is beneficial for you.\u00a0\nWe are excited, and look forward to sharing the evening of\u00a0Saturday,\u00a0February 3, 2018\u00a0together!\nScott Coles\nWMBC Founder & President"}, "CAFP Southern California 2018 Procedures Workshop": {"name": "CAFP Southern California 2018 Procedures Workshop", "start_time": "2018-02-10T09:00:00", "end_time": "2018-02-10T14:00:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cafp-southern-california-2018-procedures-workshop-tickets-41353923699?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "Welcome to the registration page for the California Academy of Family Physicians' 5th Annual Southern California Procedures Workshop!\u00a0\u00a0\nThe workshop will be hosted at the UC Irvine Medical Education Building (836 Health Sciences Road, Irvine, CA 92617) on Saturday, February 10th, 2018 from 9AM - 2PM.\u00a0 Here, you will learn various office-based procedures essential to a family medicine practice.\u00a0 The courses will be taught by family medicine physicians from the greater Southern California area, including Kaiser Permanente, UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, and UC Riverside.\u00a0\u00a0\nWorkshops include:\u00a0\n- EKG interpretation\n- Musculoskeletal exams\n- Pap smears / pelvic exam\n- IUD insertion\n- Suturing\u00a0\nThe day will begin with a light breakfast and registration at 8:30AM on the first floor of the UC Irvine Medical Education Building.\u00a0 There will be a $5 registration fee that will cover breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0\nSpace is limited - so register now!

It is a fantastic idea.\" --- Esraa (facebook)\nIn our modern world, we constantly interact with computers, cell phones, microwaves and WiFi networks, all of which produce powerful electromagnetic fields. Such devices disturb our biological energy fields and make our nervous, immune, digestive and endocrine systems less effective. If, however, we add a balancing geometric shape to the design of the device or we separately make it part of our energy field, it will restore harmony.\nIn BioGeometry, we unlock nature's own design language at the archetypal level of the universe and learn how to detect, create and amplify the beneficial centering energy quality called BG3. By\u00a0applying an ancient worldview of a qualitative universe in modern science, we can\u00a0transmute environmental energy disturbances in our bodies,\u00a0including those from electromagnetic\u00a0radiation, structural design, material, chemical,\u00a0geopathic\u00a0stress, as well as food and\u00a0drink.\n\nBioGeometry Signatures, based on over 45 years of applied research by Dr. Ibrahim Karim,\u00a0are linear diagrams that help balance the subtle energy of body organs and systems. These\u00a0powerful, but simple shapes,\u00a0create energetic patterns that introduce equilibrium and harmony into our vitality, emotional and mental well-being, as well as\u00a0mitigating the effects of electro-pollution and geopathic stress on our bodies.\nJoin Jean Menges for an introductory lecture on BioGeometry BioSignatures.\u00a0 All participants will learn how to create a BioSignatures Emitter to balance and support the subtle energy healing of various organs and systems of the body. Each participant will also receive a\u00a0BioGeometry BioSignature\u00a0book, which includes BioSignatures for balancing body's subtle energy of organs.\nJean Menges is a Licensed BioGeometry Environmental Home Solutions Practitioner and an acupuncturist practicing in New York City.\u00a0 Jean has extensive training and background in bioenergetic medicine, nutrition and herbal medicine. She also has a background working in research on molecular genetics and infectious disease.\u00a0 She is a teaching assistant for the BioGeometry Foundation and Advance Training, and an official retailer of\u00a0 the BioGeometry personal energy balancing and home harmonization products.\nHere is more information about BioGeometry and learn more on YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0\nOrder online products for EMF harmonization, personal energy balancing, and home & car protection products.

Open to 7th grade and above.\r\nArduino\u00a0\r\nThe Arduino is a microcontroller; a small computer that has a single function. Microcontrollers run everyday items like toaster ovens, electronic toys and MP3 players. An Arduino can be programmed to monitor sensors and watch for inputs like temperature, pressure, light, voltage or a button or switch. It can also be programmed to control switches, relays, motors and other outputs. Students will build a small home alarm system which consists of an ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, button and LEDs. The small home alarm system will detect nearby objects and respond according to their distance. if something gets too close, the alarm will sound and you need to push the button to reset the alarm. Open to 7th grade and above.\r\nAndroid App Development\r\nThe Android workshop will let students create an application that will simulate a countdown for new year. Students will learn how to utilize Android Studio interface and experience xml based styling. The workshop will require students to bring a laptop and Android device. Either Mac or Windows PC is OK installed with Android Studio. Pre-requisite experience Students should have basic understanding of Java. Open to 7th grade and above.\r\niOS App Development\u00a0\r\nThe iOS workshop will let students to make an application that allows them to take pictures and create a profile of a person. Students will learn how to utilize iOS interface designer, storyboards, layouts, constraints, how to perform segues, and take pictures and access the photo gallery. The workshop will require students to have a Mac, either a standard Macbook, Macbook air or Macbook pro with Xcode 8+ installed and with Swift 3.0. Students should have some basic understanding of how to program in a language such as Python, C/C++, Java or Swift.

It is simply a data structure where each block is linked to another block in a time-stamped. chronological order. It is the underlying infrastructure for bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency. In near future, many companies will be adopting blockchain technologies for various purposes. Apart from bitcoin, it can be used for a wide variety of applications such as tracking ownership, digital assets, physical assets, or voting rights. It can also store and run computer code called \u2018smart contracts\u2019. However, blockchain is still new and the communities are still exploring the best ways in which it can be used.\n\nWhy Blockchain Training?\nBlockchain Training will help you understand the underlying mechanisms of Bitcoin transaction systems,\u00a0 Ethereum & Hyperledger. Together with learning to setup your own public/private blockchain environment, you\u2019ll also master the concepts like Cryptography & Cryptocurrency, Blockchain Networks, Bitcoin Mining & Security, Multichain, developing smart contract on Ethereum & Hyperledger Platform.\n\nWhy this course ?\nWorld Economic Forum report predicted that by 2025 ten percent of global GDP will be stored on blockchain-related technologyBill & Melinda Gates Foundation aims to use blockchain technology to help the two billion people worldwide who lack bank accounts\n\nAbout The Course\nOur Blockchain Course is designed to introduce you to the concept of blockchain and explain the fundamentals of blockchain and bitcoin. The course will provide an overview of the structure and mechanism of blockchain. As a beginner, you will be learning the importance of consensus in transactions, how transactions are stored on blockchain, history of bitcoin and how to use bitcoin. Furthermore, you will be taught about the Ethereum platform and its programming language. You will setup your own private blockchain environment using Ethereum. In addition, you will develop a smart contract on private Ethereum blockchain and will be deploying the contract from web and console. Consecutively, you will learn to deploy business network using Hyperledger Composer. You will learn to set up private blockchain using Multichain platform. Towards the end of the course we will be discussing various practical use cases of blockchain to enhance your learning experience.\n\nCourse Description\nImagine it\u2019s 1994. The internet exists, but is still referred to as an \u201cinformation superhighway.\u201d This may feel a long way off from the Digital Age that defines our lives today -- where objects in our pockets power much of our activity, where we are connected to parts of the world previously unknown, and where our relationship to reality grows increasingly blended. We are well beyond websites. Blockchain technology is in that same 1994 moment, trying to imagine its own future.\nSay goodbye to the Information Superhighway and hello to the Decentralized Economy. Blockchain is about to radically transform how humans and machines engage in economic activity, forever. While humans have been using formal institutions to reduce uncertainty in trade since the dawn of time, Blockchain is evolving this age-old model into something far more interesting: the distributed autonomous institution.\nThis course is designed to take you through from the basics of Blockchain Technology to an expert level.\u00a0 Even for the most informed technologists, Blockchain Technology is very difficult and often dense subject matter to fully internalize and understand. This course is here to help students unpack the ideas and better understand what the most important opportunities are in and around this new technology. We cover the Economics, Technology, and Business of Blockchain.\n\nWho should take this course?\nAnyone having zeal to learn new technology can take up the course.

If for any reason the course has not been taken, class is cancelled or rescheduled, the payment can be applied towards any future course by Omni212.\n\nAs per GARTNER:\nThe Blockchain Revolution Promises to Touch Every Industry.\nThe blockchain revolution began with bitcoin, which used distributed ledger technology to foster trust in a currency and transaction mechanism not backed by any government or traditional institution. Visionary entrepreneurs and CIOs building and expanding digital businesses are keeping the flow of transformation going. Their goal is to reinvent the very nature of commercial activity by removing intermediaries and enabling more-fluid business processes to be conducted in diverse ecosystems.\n\nWhat is Blockchain Technology?\n\nBlockchain is the digital ledger of economic transactions worldwide.It is the world\u2019s leading platform for digital assets.\nA blockchain operates within a decentralized network of users that constructs a globally secure consensus ledger\nAnyone can access the blockchain's record and audit the activity of its network\nThe blockchain is comprised of blocks of the network users' activity or transactions, each block is chained to it's parent's ID\u00a0 (cryptographic Hash), so the longer the grows, so grows the truth.\nBlockchain technology is the foundation for Bitcoin. However if the blockchain were the island of Manhattan, Bitcoin would be but one building on it...there can be so much more\n\n\nWhy Blockchain?\nThe Blockchain is a foundational technology, like TCP/IP, which enables the Internet. And much like the Internet in the late 1990s, we don\u2019t know exactly how the Blockchain will evolve, but evolve it will.\nSimilar to the Internet, the Blockchain must also be allowed to grow unencumbered. This will require careful handling that recognizes the difference between the platform and the applications that run on it. TCP/IP empowers numerous financial applications that are regulated, but TCP/IP is not regulated as a financial instrument. The Blockchain should receive similar consideration. While the predominant use case for the Blockchain today is bitcoin currency exchange that may require regulation, this will change over time.\nHad we over-regulated the Internet early on, we would have missed out on many innovations that we can\u2019t imagine living without today. The same is true for the Blockchain. Disruptive technologies rarely fit neatly into existing regulatory considerations, but rigid regulatory frameworks have repeatedly stifled innovation. It\u2019s likely that innovations in the Blockchain will outpace policy, let\u2019s not slow it down."}, "ASCE K-12 Outreach: Judges Needed at Orange County Science and Engineering Fair": {"name": "ASCE K-12 Outreach: Judges Needed at Orange County Science and Engineering Fair", "start_time": "2018-03-14T07:30:00", "end_time": "2018-03-14T16:30:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/asce-k-12-outreach-judges-needed-at-orange-county-science-and-engineering-fair-tickets-42208645194?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "Volunteer as a judge at the 63nd annual Orange County Science Fair!

The Newport Bay Conservancy offers a tour of the Upper Newport Bay every Saturday and Sunday morning year-round.

They begin with a quick lesson (sponsored by California Department of Boating & Waterways) on how to paddle and then lead participants into the Ecological Reserve. Naturalists make several stops where they discuss various aspects of the ecology and wildlife of the Bay. Each tour is unique with startling differences in birds and other wildlife seen depending on the season and state of the tide. In summer, the open-water skimmers and terns that come here to nest predominate. In winter, there is a huge abundance and diversity of shorebirds, ducks, and grebes that have migrated from Canada and Alaska.

They are a high impact, low cost tool that can affect countless lives and inspire change in all who participate.\r\nToday, millions of children around the world have the privilege to play recreational sports. Progression Athletics International was created with a mission to bring those same opportunities to the even greater number of at-risk youth who do not have the same opportunity. Since 2011, we have impacted over 7,500 youth in six countries around the world.\r\nOne of the main programs we offer are sports clinics both domestically and internationally. At these events we provide training, T-shirts, sports bags, wrist bands, and trophies to those who demonstrate positive behavior. Many of the children we work with do not have parents, have been abused or neglected and are looking for LOVE. We try to provide this through the power of sport.\r\nAthletics have the unique power to attract, mobilize, and inspire. In order for a sport to be a success, multiple participants have to share the same vision and goal. Sports help teach life values such as respect for the opponent, competition, acceptance of binding rules, teamwork and fairness.\r\nNelson Mandela said it best: \"Sport has the power to change the world\u2026it has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers.\u201d\r\nThis is the platform Progression Athletics International provides to the youth we serve!\u00a0\r\nMore information on PAI can be found at\u00a0http://progressionathletics.org/\r\n\u00a0"}, "Foster Caring": {"name": "Foster Caring", "start_time": "2018-03-03T17:00:00", "end_time": "2018-03-03T20:30:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/foster-caring-tickets-42588480291?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "A live podcast recording of Matt Vest vs His Friends with special musical guests, Half Past Two.

Their vision is to improve the lives of foster children in America, who often find themselves forgotten and neglected by the public. They collaborate with community partners to bring resources to foster youth and use service-learning activities to educate volunteers on issues surrounding the foster care system.\u00a0TWR works with hundreds of foster agencies, social workers, CASA advocates, and other partners to bring our programs to foster youth across the nation. Their foundation has allowed them to provide thousands of foster youth across the country with new bicycles, college supplies, and suitcases so that children do not have to travel from home to home with their belongings in a trash bag."}, "CCD Foundation Benefit - 5K RUNWALK In Color": {"name": "CCD Foundation Benefit - 5K RUN/WALK In Color", "start_time": "2018-06-02T07:00:00", "end_time": "2018-06-03T11:00:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ccd-foundation-benefit-5k-runwalk-in-color-tickets-39557099349?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "CCD Foundation presents\u00a0\"A Day of Fun & Resources, Fundraiser Benefit\"\n5K Run/Walk 7:00am\nCancer & Diabetes Siminar 2:30pm\nAll White White Linen Benefit Luncheon\nCancer & Diabetes Benefit Concert 7:00pm\nBecome A Sponsor Call: 951.785.0306\nVender Booth Sales: 951.785.0306\nSee site for full details ccdfoundationinc.org\n* The promoter of this event & The City of Anaheim shall not be held liable for any injuries.All Participants do so at their own risk."}, "CCD Foundation Cancer & Diabetes Benefit Seminar": {"name": "CCD Foundation Cancer & Diabetes Benefit Seminar", "start_time": "2018-06-02T15:00:00", "end_time": "2018-06-02T17:00:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ccd-foundation-cancer-diabetes-benefit-seminar-tickets-40995286004?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "\n\n\nHosted by: Riverwalk Physicians Services.\nLecture Topics: Cancer Risk Assessment\nDiabetic Risk Factors!

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states. What will this mean to the next generations? For those of us with children and grandchildren, we may well ask: What kind of world will our children inherit? Beyond this one ruling we see many other signs of cultural change that makes us wonder what the future holds. Will there be a world to inherit?\r\nThen there is increasing and dangerous political unrest. The Middle East is in crisis. Europe is increasing its role as a world power to counter what is happening in the Middle East and from Russia. At the same time, America, the world\u2019s leading power and long-standing bastion of liberty and freedom, is losing share in global leadership.\r\nThis is a sobering time! But God has a message for you to help you understand, cope and survive these times. We need to seriously consider what God has to say.\r\nGod is not absent from this world. He is the God of history. He directs great events that will culminate in His purpose and plan for humankind. God has a purpose for your life, and you can understand what that great purpose is.\r\nWe invite you to come and hear a presentation given by our three Beyond Today television presenters, Steve Myers, Darris McNeely and Gary Petty. As we do each week on Beyond Today, we will give you a message of understanding and hope from the Bible. More than anything else you need to understand what God is saying in His Word as well as what He is doing. We will help you make sense of the often confusing and chaotic conditions of life.\r\nOur one-day event, America: The Time Is Now! will be coming to Garden Grove, California, on March 11.

I have attended most all mediums that have presented at Kindred. You-- by far were the most captivating....and spot on...with us all. God blessed and blesses you.\nNancy H., Shelby, NC I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the reading. I was quite a skeptic before I \"accidentally\" found my way to your weekly meeting. The things you told me totally convinced me that you were, indeed, receiving messages from my dad and brother. There was such a sense of overwhelming love, forgiveness and healing. Thank you so very much for being a Voice for the Voiceless. \nStephanie W., Anoka, MN Having a session with Beecham Parker allowed me to receive the communication that I needed with my dog. I have struggled with his early passing for several years and having this reading gave me a sense of relief and peace. I found him to be not only accurate with his information but also extremelly compassionate in his delivery. I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders\nLana, Chicago, IL You were very accurate on many things.\u00a0You really blew me away when you mentioned Madison because the only two people that knew about that was me and my husband. Thank you again for a great reading!Tom S., Humble, TX With Beecham, it is \"more real than real.\" From the very first image he saw, it became clear to me, once a skeptic, that Beecham was talking with my departed Love. Knowing nothing about me or her, he described precisely the unusual way she died. He managed to convey all the information I needed to hear to heal my searing grief."}, "Enlightened Heart Sunday Celebration Sundays in Irvine 10:30am": {"name": "Enlightened Heart Sunday Celebration Sundays in Irvine 10:30am", "start_time": "2018-02-04T10:30:00", "end_time": "2018-02-04T12:00:00", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/enlightened-heart-sunday-celebration-sundays-in-irvine-1030am-tickets-42147491281?aff=ebapi", "alive": "live", "description": "Enlightened Heart Sunday Celebration Sundays in Irvine 10:30am, inspiration and live music\nSUNDAY MEDITATION - WE are shifting Thoughts and our Love into Action - Everyone welcome, no pre-requsites.\nEVERY Sunday Morning a Guided Meditation and Inspirational Message in a peaceful, safe, sacred space.

They have existed since the dawn of civilization and permeate throughout every culture. Today's stories come in all shapes and sizes including books, television shows, video games and Hollywood blockbusters. However, what's sometimes not fully appreciated is how the epic heroic story starts inside each of us. Every human creates the tales of their lives with specific patterns and structures. This process has been mapped by many disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, economics, marketing, and even screen writing. There are many ways to apply the knowledge, but this workshop explores how using these insights to work with children and teens can create fantastic and positive changes.\u00a0\nIn this workshop, participants are introduced to the \"Blockbuster Parenting\" conceptualization approach. This methodology is an amalgamation of multidisciplinary research and clinical experience that provides a conceptualization tool to effectively work with dysfunctional behaviors of children and adolescents using epic story structure as a basis for understanding human goals and behaviors.\nThis Course meets the qualifications for 2 hours of continuing education credit for LMFTs, LCSWs, LPCCs, and/or LEPs as required by the California Board of Behavioral Sciences.

If we had to say what underpins America today, if we were forced to choose our core beliefs or values as a nation, it\u2019s not clear that we could readily do so. Do we still believe, for example, in liberty, life, and the pursuit of happiness? That all men are created equal? Do we still believe in the right to religious freedom? In free speech and freedom of the press? How about our electoral system? Due process? Do we still believe in democracy and representative government? Do we still care, or even give lip-service to caring, about the poor, the marginalized, the vulnerable at home and around the world? Do we still hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction? These are all questions with which the Trump presidency, the rise of the extreme right and recent gerrymandering lawsuits have forced us to reckon. Do we instead believe, with the president, that might and money should rule the country and the world? Do we believe that political parties have the right to shape the electorate to keep themselves in power? Do we believe that some Americans are more American than others? Our keynote speaker and our panels, which comprise thinkers and visionaries from all over the world along with a diverse group of American experts, will focus on the many complicated ways to address and to answer the most important question of all: Who Do We Think We Are?\n\n\nFree and open to the public.
